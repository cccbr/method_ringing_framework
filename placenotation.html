                                    would take Row 1234567 to Row 2314756.
                                    Note that there is no overlap of Places in the three sections of the notation.<br />

                                    (14)(53) should not be used as the Places in the second section overlap with the Places in the first section.
                                    This Change is more clearly described as [23514].<br />

                                    (24)[765]8 defines the Royal Change that
                                    would take Row 1234567890 to Row 1342765809. Again there is no overlap of Places between sections of the notation.

                                Dot notation is used to delineate Changes in the same way as for standard place notation.
                                Dots are only omitted before and after the cross Change.
                                Also, as with standard place notation, internal Places Made are always specified, even when
                                these could be inferred.

                                    (31)4[765] correctly defines a Triples Change. Convention is to include the 4 since it's an internal

                                When a Method has the structure A, B, ~A, C as described in A.7 above,
                                there is an additional consideration when Jump Changes are involved.
                                Adjacent Changes are self-inverse, meaning that the same Change applied twice in succession brings you back to the starting Row.
                                However this may not apply to Jump Changes.
                                Therefore if a Method with Jump Changes has a structure including ~A, not only are the Changes in ~A in reverse order,
                                but any Jump Changes in A are inverted in ~A.<br />
                                Furthermore, the comma notation described in A.7 above should not be used if Change B or Change C are not self-inverse Changes.
                                In this case, the sequence of Changes should be written in full, without the use of the comma notation.
