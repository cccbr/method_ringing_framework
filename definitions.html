                                        <b>Further explanation:</b> Bells are incrementally numbered in order from the bell with the highest pitch
                                        to the bell with the lowest pitch, and may be referred to using either cardinal or ordinal numbers.
                                        Number 1 is used for the bell with the highest pitch, number 2 for the next highest pitch and so on.

                                        When using ordinal numbers, bell number 2 becomes 'the 2nd', bell number 3 becomes 'the 3rd', and so on.
                                        However bell number 1 is usually referred to as 'the treble' rather than 'the 1st', and the bell with the lowest pitch
                                        is usually referred to as 'the tenor' rather than the corresponding ordinal.
                                    </p>
                                    <p class="text-primary">
                                        The numbering of bells always relates solely to the set of bells comprising the Row, ignoring any other available bells
                                        that are not being used at the time.

                                        Rows are normally shown in columns so that the path of individual bells can be visualised by looking down the columns.
                                        In order to keep the columns aligned, a fixed font can be used with single characters representing each bell.
                                        Conventionally '0' (zero) is used to represent 10 and upper case letters (excluding 'I', 'O' and 'X') are
                                        used for bells 11 to 33 as follows:

                                        so Place 2 is usually '2nd's Place'. 2nd's Place here is a reference to the Place the
                                        2nd bell occupies when ringing Rounds.

                                        The bell in 1st's Place is often said to be Leading, and the bell in the
                                        last Place of the Row is often said to be Lying. E.g. in the Row 214365,

                                        may be modified to exclude the Cover Bell(s). E.g. when ringing Triples (see Section H) with a Cover
                                        Bell in 8th's Place, the bell in 7th's place may be said to be Lying.

                                        E.g. for 4-bell Changes, the place notation ‘14’ indicates that the Leading and Lying bells stay in the same
                                        Place across Rows, and the bells in 2nd's and 3rd's Places swap.  So if Change '14' is applied to Row 2143,
                                        the resulting Row would be 2413.

                                        In Place Notation, single character representations of bells are used for Places above 9th's Place (e.g. "9T").
                                        The symbols 'x', 'X' or '-' are all used to denote a Change on an even number of bells where
                                        no bell stays in the same Place, so all pairs of bells swap.

                                        Dots are used to delineate between consecutive Changes where at least one bell

                                        Changes) can optionally be represented as '4.5' since the '1' and '8' can be implied.

                                        Later Rows in the same Composition could be produced by applying a Minimus Method to Places 1 to 4,

                                        A Composition specifies how the various Methods, Calls and Cover Bells it uses are applied throughout

                                        These Changes produce one Plain Lead, bringing up the row 1423 when starting from Rounds, as

                                        If these Changes are applied twice more, Rounds is produced.
                                        Bastow Little Bob Minimus therefore has 3 Plain Leads in its Plain Course.

                                        When the number of Rows in a Block is less than or equal to the number of Rows in
                                        the Extent of the Block's Effective Stage, the definition of True simplifies to 'a Block
                                        that has no repeated Rows'. However, the definition of True becomes more
                                        involved when a Block has more Rows than the number of Rows in the Extent of the
