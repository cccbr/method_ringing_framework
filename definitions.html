                                    <b>Further explanation:</b> Bells are incrementally numbered in order from the bell with the highest pitch
                                    to the bell with the lowest pitch, and may be referred to using either cardinal or ordinal numbers.
                                    Number 1 is used for the bell with the highest pitch, number 2 for the next highest pitch and so on.
                                </p>
                                <p class="text-primary">
                                    When using ordinal numbers, bell number 2 becomes 'the 2nd', bell number 3 becomes 'the 3rd', and so on.
                                    However bell number 1 is usually referred to as 'the treble' rather than 'the 1st', and the bell with the lowest pitch
                                    is usually referred to as 'the tenor' rather than the corresponding ordinal.
                                </p>
                                <p class="text-primary">
                                    The numbering of bells always relates solely to the set of bells comprising the Row, ignoring any other available bells
                                    that are not being used at the time.
                                </p>
                                <p class="text-primary">
                                    Rows are normally shown in columns so that the path of individual bells can be visualised by looking down the columns.
                                    In order to keep the columns aligned, a fixed font can be used with single characters representing each bell.
                                    Conventionally '0' (zero) is used to represent the 10th, and upper (or sometimes lower) case
                                    letters (excluding 'I', 'O' and 'X') are used for bells 11 to 33 as follows:

                                    Places are usually referred to using ordinal numbers in the possessive form,
                                    so Place 2 is usually '2nd's Place'. 2nd's Place is a reference to the Place the
                                    2nd bell occupies when ringing Rounds.

                                    The bell in 1st's Place is often said to be leading, and the bell in the
                                    last Place of the Row is often said to be lying. E.g. in the Row 214365,
                                    the 2nd is leading and the 5th is lying.

                                    Note that in a Row containing one or more Cover Bells, the numbering of the Places
                                    may be modified to exclude the Cover Bell(s). E.g. when ringing Triples with a Cover
                                    Bell in 8th's Place, the bell in 7th's Place may be said to be lying.

                                    Changes are often represented using place notation. This notation is formed by writing the Places of bells
                                    that remain in the same Place from one Row to the next Row, working from beginning to end in the Row.
                                    All remaining bells swap Places with the bell next to them.

                                <p class="text-primary">
                                    E.g. for 4-bell Changes, the place notation ‘14’ indicates that the leading and lying bells stay in the same
                                    Place across Rows, and the bells in 2nd's and 3rd's Places swap.  So if Change '14' is applied to Row 2143,
                                    the resulting Row is 2413.

                                    In place notation, single character representations of bells are used for Places above 9th's Place (e.g. "9T").
                                    The symbols 'x' or '-' are used to denote a Change on an even number of bells where
                                    no bell stays in the same Place, so all pairs of bells swap.
                                </p>

                                    Dots are used to delineate between consecutive Changes where at least one bell
                                    remains in the same Place in both Changes (e.g. '14.58'). '14.58' (when referring, e.g., to 8-bell
                                    Changes) can optionally be represented as '4.5' since the '1' and '8' can be implied.

                                        <b>Further explanation:</b> Dixon's Bob Minor specifies that Rows are generated by successively
                                        applying the pair of Changes x16 except (a) if the Treble is leading after an x

                                        In this Method, the sequence of Changes varies depending on the Rows generated, so using a
                                        different starting Row could generate a different sequence of Changes.  This Method's
                                        sequence of Changes is therefore not fixed, and so Dixon's Bob Minor is an example of
                                        a Dynamic Method.

                                        <b>Further explanation:</b> A Round Block is considered as a cycle of Rows
                                        generated by Changes from a starting Row (usually Rounds) and finishing
                                        by returning to the same Row. As it starts and finishes with the same Row, either
                                        the initial Row or the final Row (but not both) is counted as a Row of the Round Block.
                                        This is important when counting how many Rows or Extents have been rung and
                                        when assessing whether a Block is True.

                                        to avoid counting the usual repetition of Rounds (or an alternative Row) at the beginning

                                        In this example, it can be seen that a total of 9 Rows were rung,
                                        including both the initial Rounds and the final Rounds. However, 8
                                        Changes (as represented by place notations on the left) are used to
                                        produce it. As it is a Round Block, either the starting Rounds
                                        or the finishing Rounds (but not both) are considered to be part of the Block
                                        and therefore it contains 8 Rows, all distinct.
