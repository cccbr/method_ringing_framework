                                        to the bell with the lowest pitch, and may be referred to using either cardinal or ordinal numbers.
                                        Number 1 is used for the bell with the highest pitch, number 2 for the next highest pitch and so on.

                                    <p class="text-primary">
                                        When using ordinal numbers, bell number 2 becomes 'the 2nd', bell number 3 becomes 'the 3rd', and so on.
                                        However bell number 1 is usually referred to as 'the treble' rather than 'the 1st', and the bell with the lowest pitch
                                        is usually referred to as 'the tenor' rather than the corresponding ordinal.
                                    </p>

                                        The numbering of bells always relates solely to the set of bells comprising the Row, ignoring any other available bells
                                        that are not being used at the time.

                                        Rows are normally shown in columns so that the path of individual bells can be visualised by looking down the columns.
                                        In order to keep the columns aligned, a fixed font can be used with single characters representing each bell.
                                        Conventionally '0' (zero) is used to represent the 10th, and upper case letters (excluding 'I', 'O' and 'X') are
                                        used for bells 11 to 33 as follows:

                                        Places are usually referred to using ordinal numbers in the possessive form,
                                        so Place 2 is usually '2nd's Place'. 2nd's Place is a reference to the Place the

                                        The bell in 1st's Place is often said to be Leading, and the bell in the
                                        last Place of the Row is often said to be Lying. E.g. in the Row 214365,
                                        the 2nd is Leading and the 5th is Lying.

                                        Changes are often represented using Place Notation. This notation is formed by writing the Places of bells that remain
                                        in the same Place from one Row to the next Row, working from beginning to end in the Row.
                                        All remaining bells swap Places with the bell next to them.
                                    </p>
                                    <p class="text-primary">
                                        E.g. for 4-bell Changes, the place notation ‘14’ indicates that the Leading and Lying bells stay in the same
                                        Place across Rows, and the bells in 2nd's and 3rd's Places swap.  So if Change '14' is applied to Row 2143,
                                        the resulting Row would be 2413.
                                    </p>
                                    <p class="text-primary">
                                        In Place Notation, single character representations of bells are used for Places above 9th's Place (e.g. "9T").
                                        The symbols 'x' or '-' are used to denote a Change on an even number of bells where
                                        no bell stays in the same Place, so all pairs of bells swap.
                                    </p>
                                    <p class="text-primary">
                                        Dots are used to delineate between consecutive Changes where at least one bell
                                        remains in the same Place in both Changes (e.g. '14.58'). '14.58' (when referring, e.g., to 8-bell
                                        Changes) can optionally be represented as '4.5' since the '1' and '8' can be implied.

                                        8th's Place is therefore a Fixed Cover Place.

                                        in all Rows of a Block, the same effect can be achieved in different ways.  For example, a Method may keep a bell
                                        in the same Place in every Row; or a Method may keep a bell in the same Place in most Rows, but Calls
                                        are used that keep that bell in the same Place in every Row.  Regardless of how the Rows are generated,
