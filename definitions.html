                                    <b>Further explanation:</b> Bells are incrementally numbered in order from the bell with the highest pitch
                                    to the bell with the lowest pitch, and may be referred to using either cardinal or ordinal numbers.
                                    Number 1 is used for the bell with the highest pitch, number 2 for the next highest pitch and so on.
                                </p>
                                <p class="text-primary">
                                    When using ordinal numbers, bell number 2 becomes 'the 2nd', bell number 3 becomes 'the 3rd', and so on.
                                    However bell number 1 is usually referred to as 'the treble' rather than 'the 1st', and the bell with the lowest pitch
                                    is usually referred to as 'the tenor' rather than the corresponding ordinal.
                                </p>
                                <p class="text-primary">
                                    The numbering of bells always relates solely to the set of bells comprising the Row, ignoring any other available bells
                                    that are not being used at the time.
                                </p>
                                <p class="text-primary">
                                    Rows are normally shown in columns so that the path of individual bells can be visualised by looking down the columns.
                                    In order to keep the columns aligned, a fixed font can be used with single characters representing each bell.
                                    Conventionally '0' (zero) is used to represent the 10th, and upper case letters (excluding 'I', 'O' and 'X') are
                                    used for bells 11 to 33 as follows:

                                    Changes are often represented using Place Notation. This notation is formed by writing the Places of bells that remain
                                    in the same Place from one Row to the next Row, working from beginning to end in the Row.
                                    All remaining bells swap Places with the bell next to them.
                                </p>
                                <p class="text-primary">
                                    E.g. for 4-bell Changes, the place notation ‘14’ indicates that the Leading and Lying bells stay in the same
                                    Place across Rows, and the bells in 2nd's and 3rd's Places swap.  So if Change '14' is applied to Row 2143,
                                    the resulting Row would be 2413.

                                    In Place Notation, single character representations of bells are used for Places above 9th's Place (e.g. "9T").
                                    The symbols 'x' or '-' are used to denote a Change on an even number of bells where
                                    no bell stays in the same Place, so all pairs of bells swap.
                                </p>

                                    Dots are used to delineate between consecutive Changes where at least one bell
                                    remains in the same Place in both Changes (e.g. '14.58'). '14.58' (when referring, e.g., to 8-bell
                                    Changes) can optionally be represented as '4.5' since the '1' and '8' can be implied.

                                    forwards or backwards. Where a Method has palindromic symmetry, it may be recorded in shorthand in a
                                    Method Library in a form such as &x16x14+12. In this example, the '&' indicates that the portion
                                    before the '+' must also be reversed (except for the last change) to produce the palindromic section,
                                    before then adding the portion after the '+'.

                                    <b>Further explanation:</b> Dixon's Bob Minor specifies that Rows are generated by successively
                                    applying the pair of Changes x16 except (a) if the Treble is leading after an x
                                    Change, replace the next 16 Change with a 12 Change, and (b) if the 2nd or 4th is

                                    In this Method, the sequence of Changes varies depending on the Rows generated, so using a
                                    different starting Row could generate a different sequence of Changes.  This Method's
                                    sequence of Changes is therefore not fixed, and so Dixon's Bob Minor is an example of
                                    a Dynamic Method.

                                    It is possible to use more than one Method to produce a single Row.
                                    E.g. a Composition could produce 12-bell Rows by having a Cover Bell in Place 1,
                                    applying a Doubles Method to Places 2 to 6, and applying a Minor Method to Places 7 to 12.
                                    Later Rows in the same Composition could be produced by applying a Minimus Method to Places 1 to 4,
                                    having a Cover Bell in 5th's Place, and applying a Triples Method to Places 6 to 12.
                                    A Composition specifies how the various Methods, Calls and Cover Bells it uses are applied throughout
                                    the Composition to generate Rows.

                                    There is no requirement to use whole multiples of a Method's
                                    Changes in a Composition. Any portion of a Method's Changes can be used as part of a Composition.

                                    Cover Bells are ringing in 6th's, 7th's and 8th's Places. Calls are used in the Composition such that

                                    8th's Place is therefore a Fixed Cover Place.

                                    in all Rows of a Block, the same effect can be achieved in different ways.  For example, a Method may keep a bell
                                    in the same Place in every Row; or a Method may keep a bell in the same Place in most Rows, but Calls
                                    are used that keep that bell in the same Place in every Row.  Regardless of how the Rows are generated,
                                    if the same bell rings in the same Place in every Row of a Block, that Place is a Fixed Cover Place.
