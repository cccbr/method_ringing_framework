                                Below are the processes that are currently recognized by the Central Council for extending Methods to higher Stages.
                                Method designers may apply one of these processes to the place notation of a Parent Method in order to obtain the
                                place notation for a higher Stage Method.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            	Only one process may be used to extend any one method -- processes may not be combined.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            	Some of the processes involve setting parameters (e.g. a mode), which are chosen by the method designer.
                                These processes produce different extension place notations depending on the parameters used.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            	Method designers should decide which process, and where applicable, which process parameters, to use to obtain their desired extension.
							</p>

							<p>
								Once a candidate extension place notation has been produced, the resulting method should be assessed against the criteria in Section 8.C
								to determing whether it may, if rung in a qualifying performance, be given the same name as its parent method.

                                The designated code for referring to this process is "1/m", where m is the mode.  For example, Stedman is extended using process 1/3.

                                for Stedman.  1/3 is designated as the one used.

                                Process 2 extends a parent method that has one or more hunt bells by adding an additional hunt bell.
                                The extension is one stage higher than the parent, and the lead length is two changes longer.
                                Most commonly this extension process is used to extend a parent method with one hunt bell to a twin hunt method.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                However, this process can also be used to extend a twin hunt parent method to a method with three hunt bells, and so on.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Prerequisites for this process are as follows:

                            <ol>
                                <li>
                                    The hunt bell(s) follow a Plain Hunting path (i.e. the path consists of hunting up to nth's place, making nth's, hunting down to mth's place, making mth's).
                                </li>

                                <li>
                                    If the parent method has more than one plain hunting bell, they must all be coursing, meaning they each have the same path but visit each place two rows later than an earlier hunt bell.
                                </li>
                                
                                <li>
                                    No places are made above a hunt bell place that transitions the hunt bell from hunting up to hunting down.
                                </li>

                                    No places are made below a hunt bell place that transitions the hunt bell from hunting down to hunting up.

                                The designated code for referring to this process is "2". For example, St Simon's Bob Doubles is extended to St Simon's Bob Minor using process 2.

                                Process 3 extends a parent method by replicating and possibly expanding some of its changes.
                                This process is designed primarily to extend parent methods that have one Plain or Treble Dodging
                                hunt bell, or an Alliance path that comprises Hunting and Treble Dodging.

                                The steps to implement this process are shown in the following example:

                                b is the beginning location of the section to be copied, and e is the ending location of the section to be copied.
                                Below the treble, b and e are numbered starting from the half-lead change and working back towards the start of the lead.
                                The half-lead change is numbered 0, the change before the half-lead is numbered 1, and so on.
                                Above the treble, b and e are numbered starting from the lead end change and working forwards towards the half lead.
                                The lead end change is numbered 0, the change after the lead end is numbered 1, and so on.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                m is the mode.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                s is the step size.

                            <p>
                                The section before the colon refers to below the treble, and the section after the colon refers to above the treble.
                                For example, Milton Surprise Minor is extended using process 3/4-7/2/2:4-7/2/2.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                When the same results are obtained by copying different sections, designate the section closest to the half lead (below the treble)
                                or closest to the lead end (above the treble) as the one that was copied.  E.g. in Milton Surprise Minor, if section 0-3 was copied
                                instead of 4-7 (both below and above the treble), the same results would be obtained.  Therefore Milton should be described as
                                being extended using process 3/0-3/2/2:0-3/2/2.  (The earlier section was used in the example to show what happens after the copied section.)
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                When two or more different modes give the same results, designate the mode used as the lowest one.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Plain methods are usually extended by copying a 2-change section and using a step size of 2.
                                Treble Dodging methods are usually extended by copying a 4-change section and using a step size of 2.
                                Both of these extend the parent method by two stages.
                                But other combinations are possible.  E.g. for a treble dodging method, an 8-change section may be copied, and a step size of 4 used.
                                This would result in the extension being 4 stages higher than the parent.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Different length sections may be copied below and above the treble.  For example, in a treble dodging method,
                                an 8-change section may be copied, and a step size of 4 used, below the treble.
                                Above the treble, a 4-change section may be copied, and a step size of 2 used.
                                In order to extend the lead length by the same amount below and above, the process above the treble would need to be applied twice
                                for every one time the process below the treble is applied.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Finally, the example and descriptions above assume the parent method is symmetrical about the lead end and half-lead changes.
                                For asymmetric methods, process 3 may be applied separately in both halves of the lead.  However, the same mode must be
                                used below the treble in both halves of the lead, and the same mode must be used above the treble in both halves of the lead.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                If the asymmetry applies only to the places below the treble, or only to the places above the treble (i.e. the other is symmetrical),
                                process 3 is applied separately in both halves for the asymmetric places, and only once for the symmetric places (in order to retain
                                that symmetry).
                            </p>
