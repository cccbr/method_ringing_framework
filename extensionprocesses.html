                                Some of the processes involve setting parameters (e.g. a mode), which are chosen by the Method designer.
                                Different Extensions can result depending on the parameters used.
                                Method designers should decide which process, and where applicable, which process parameters, to use to obtain their desired Extension.

                                    The Parent Method is a Principle, a Differential that is not a Hunter, or a Hunter (including a Differential Hunter) with a Hunt Bell that has a Little Path.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    The Parent Method does not use Jump Changes.
                                </li>

                                The steps to implement this process are shown using the following example where <a href="https://complib.org/method/11932">Little Bob Minor</a> is the Parent Method:
                            </p>

                            </p>

                            <ol>
                                <li>
                                    Select a mode m, where m is between 1 and the Stage of the Parent Method, inclusive.
                                    In the example above, the selected mode is 4.
                                </li>
                                
                                <li>
                                    Divide the place notation (shown in column pn) of the Parent Method into Places Made up to and including the mode,
                                    and Places Made above the mode.  These Places are entered in the columns headed <=m and >m respectively.                                    
                                </li>

                                    To obtain the first Extension (which is two Stages higher = Major), leave the Places in column <=m unchanged,
                                    and increase the Places in column >m by two.  See the box for Major above.
                                </li>

                                <li>
                                    Then recombine the Places in column <=m and column >m to obtain the place notation for the Extension to Major.
                                </li>

                                <li>
                                    The above can be repeated to obtain additional Extensions in steps of 2 Stages, as shown above for Royal and Maximus.
                                </li>

                                    So 5 and 5 in the Parent Method in column A become 6 and 6 in the Extension one Change earlier (highlighted in lighter pink).

                                    The section letters are shown in the example above under the 'Sect below' and 'Sect above' headings.
                                    Note that in the Parent Method these two columns each contain the same section letters -- this changes in the Extensions.

                                    Select a mode to be used above the treble and below the treble.
                                    Mode is between 1 and the Stage of the Method, inclusive.
                                    For the example above, mode 2 has been selected for both above and below the treble.
                                    However, the modes can be different above and below.
                                </li>

                                <li>
                                    Divide the place notation (shown in column pn) of the Parent Method into Places Made below the treble ("B"),
                                    Places Made by the treble ("H" for Hunt Bel), and Places Made above the treble ("A").
                                </li>

                                <li>
                                    The Places Made above the treble are then inverted -- i.e. they are counted from the back of the Row instead of from the front.
                                    For example, 5th's Place in Minor becomes 2nd's Place when counted from the back.
                                </li>

                                <li>
                                    Then sub-divide the Places above the treble and below the treble into those that are less than or equal to the mode, and those greater than the mode.
                                    In the example above, since the mode selected is 2, Places in 1st's or 2nd's are in one sub-division, and the other Places are in the other sub-division.
                                </li>

                                <li>
                                    The resulting Places are then entered into their respective 5 columns as shown above: B (<=m), B (>m), H, Inv A (>m), and Inv A (<=m),
                                    where m is the mode.
                                </li>

                                <li>
                                    Select a set of adjacent sections below the treble to copy.
                                    There must be an even number of adjacent sections in the set.
                                    In the example above, sections D and E have been chosen for copying (shaded in lighter green).
                                </li>

                                <li>
                                    Determine the step size. The step size is equal to the number of sections in the set selected for copying.
                                    In the example above, since two sections have been selected (D and E), the step size is 2.
                                    The step size also determines the number of Stages higher the Extension will be.
                                    In the example above with a step size of 2, Minor will be extended to Major.
                                </li>

                                <li>
                                    The Places in the selected sections are copied and inserted into the sequence immediately following
                                    the selected sections.<br />
                                    For Places that are less than or equal to the mode, no changes are made to these Places during the copying.<br />
                                    For Places that are greater than the mode, these are increased by the step size when copied.<br />
                                    In the example above, the inserted sections are shown in darker green.  It can be seen that Places 12
                                    remain as 12 in the inserted sections, whereas 3 becomes 5 in the inserted sections.
                                </li>

                                <li>
                                    The inserted sections are given the same lettering as the sections they were copied from,
                                    but modified to reflect the increase of the Places.
                                    So in the Extension to Major, D and E are copied to new sections that are labelled D2 and E2 respectively.
                                </li>

                                <li>
                                    Places in the sections following the sections that have been inserted are also increased by the step size s
                                    if they are greater than the mode m.<br />
                                    In the example above, the sections following the inserted sections are shaded in orange.  It can be seen that Places 12
                                    remain 12, whereas 5 becomes 7 in the Extension.
                                </li>

                                <li>
                                    The lettering of the sections following the inserted sections is modified to reflect the increase of the Places.
                                    In the example above, F and G in the Parent Method become F2 and G2 in the Extension to Major.
                                </li>

                                <li>
                                    The process for extending the Places above the treble is the same as below the treble, except that the copying and expanding
                                    occurs in the reverse direction (i.e. starting from the half lead and working back towards the start of the lead).
                                    In the example above, sections C and D are selected for copying above the treble.
                                    These are inserted earlier in the lead as C2 and D2 respectively.
                                    The sections before the inserted sections (A and B) become A2 and B2 respectively in the Extension to Major.
                                </li>

                                <li>
                                    Increase the upper Place of the treble by the step size and move it to the new Half-Lead Change. So 6 in Minor becomes 8 in Major in the example above.
                                </li>

                                <li>
                                    Then reinvert the Places in the two Inv A columns, and recombine the Places in all 5 columns to obtain the place
                                    notation for the Extension.
                                </li>

                                <li>
                                    Rotate the new Method if required to give the desired Extension.
                                </li>

                                <li>
                                    To obtain further Extensions at higher Stages, each higher by the step size, the sections selected for copying can be inserted repeatedly,
                                    increasing the Places that are greater than the mode by the step size for each insertion.
                                    For example in the example above, Royal is obtained by inserting the D, E sections below the treble twice, once as D2, E2, and again as D4, E4.
                                    To obtain Maximus, the C, D sections above the treble have been inserted three times, once as C2, D2, once as C4, D4, and again as C6, D6.

                                    Sections C and D were copied above the treble, and sections D and E were copied below the treble.

                                    The example above uses a set of two adjacent sections to be copied and inserted, giving an Extension that is two Stages higher.
                                    Larger sets of sections can be copied and inserted, provided the number of sections is even.  For example, sections D, E, F and G
                                    could be selected for copying and inserting.
                                    Since four sections are involved, the step size is 4, and so the first Extension would be four Stages higher than the Parent Method.
                                    D4, E4, F4 and G4 sections would be inserted in the first Extension.
                                    In the next Extension (which would be eight Stages higher than the Parent Method), D8, E8, F8 and G8 sections would also be inserted, and so on.
                                    Superlative Surprise Major is an example of a Method that extends in steps of 4 Stages.

                                <li>
                                    Different size sets of sections may be copied and inserted above and below the treble.
                                    For example, sections D, E, F and G could be selected below the treble, and sections A and B could be selected above the treble.
                                    In order to extend the Lead Length by the same amount above and below the treble, the sections above the treble would need to be copied and inserted twice
                                    for every one time the sections below the treble are copied and inserted.
                                    The resulting Extension in this example is four Stages higher than the Parent Method.
                                    D4, E4, F4 and G4 sections would be inserted below the treble in the first Extension.
                                    A4, B4, A2 and B2 sections would be inserted above the treble in the first Extension.

                                    When the same results are obtained by copying different sections, designate the section closest to the half lead (below the treble)
                                    or closest to the lead end (above the treble) as the one that was copied.
                                    E.g. in the Milton Surprise Minor example above, it can be seen that if sections F and G were copied below the treble instead of sections D and E (while keeping the mode as 2)
                                    the same results would be obtained.
                                    Therefore the Extension Process in this example should be described as 3/2AB/2FG, rather than 3/2CD/2DE.
                                    (The CD and DE sections were used in the example to show what happens before and after the copied sections.)

                                <li>
                                    When two or more different modes give the same results, designate the mode used as the lowest one.
                                </li>

                                <li>
                                    Finally, the example and descriptions above assume the Parent Method is symmetrical about the Lead-End Change and Half-Lead Change.
                                    For asymmetric methods, process 3 may be applied separately in both halves of the Lead.
                                    However, the same mode must be used below the treble in both halves of the lead,
                                    and the same mode must be used above the treble in both halves of the lead.
                                </li>

                                <li>
                                    If the asymmetry applies only to the places below the treble, or only to the places above the treble (i.e. the other is symmetrical),
                                    process 3 is applied separately in both halves for the asymmetric places, and only once for the symmetric places (in order to retain
                                    that symmetry).
                                </li>
