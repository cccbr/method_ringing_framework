                                When using place notation to describe a sequence of Changes, a dot is inserted between the place notation for each change.
                                However the dot is omitted on either side of a cross Change.

                                Many Methods have a sequence of Changes that takes the form A, B, ~A, C, where A is a sequence of Changes,
                                ~A is the same sequence of Changes as A but in reverse order, and B and C are individual Changes.
                                These methods have Palindromic Symmetry (see Section 4.B.1).<br />
                                As an alternative to notating the sequence in full, comma notation can be used to save space, as follows:

                                <ul>
                                    <li>
                                        Where two sequences of Changes (represented by place notation) are separated by a comma,
                                        this indicates that each of these sequences
                                        is to be interpreted as a palindrome and expanded as follows:
                                        When the last Change in the sequence is reached, the Changes are then repeated in the reverse order
                                        starting with the penultimate Change, if any.
                                        <br />
                                        <br />
                                    </li>

                                    <li>
                                        Where there is only a single Change on either side of the comma, there is no penultimate change
                                        as described above, and therefore nothing to expand. The single Change is therefore incorporated
                                        without adjustment.
                                        <br />
                                        <br />

                                    <li>
                                        A method with a sequence of Changes of the form A, B, ~A, C can therefore be notated: AB,C

                                    So, the Caters Change [6543] above could also be specified as [216543879].

                                (iii) Separate square bracketed notation into the smallest sets of contiguous Places.

                                Adjacent and Identity Changes are self-inverse, meaning that the same Change applied twice in succession produces the starting Row.
                                However this may not apply to Jump Changes.
                                Therefore, when the comma notation described in Section A.7 above is used and Jump Changes are involved,
                                not only are the Changes in ~A in reverse order,
                                but any Jump Changes in A are inverted in ~A.

                                The comma notation described in Section A.7 above should not be used if the last Change in the sequences on both
                                sides of the comma are not self-inverse Changes.
                                Such a Method would not have Palindromic Symmetry, and use of the comma notation would therefore be misleading.
