                                    This is excellent work, thank you.
                                    I have some comments on Appendix C. Leadhead Codes.
                                    Section F describes “Alternative Leadhead Code System” relating to “the number
                                    of Plain Leads of Plain Bob that it takes to reach the same Leadhead as it does
                                    with one Plain Lead of the Method in question ”. The description is clear but the
                                    examples relate to even stages only, as does the mapping between the existing
                                    letter codes and the alternative number codes. The present letter codes are also
                                    defined for Plain Bob leadheads for odd stages, and for Grandsire leadheads for
                                    both odd and even stages. So could the description of the alternative leadhead
                                    code system, and the mapping tables, be extended to include Plain Bob leadheads
                                    for odd stages, and Grandsire leadheads for both odd and even stages please?
                                </i>
                            </p>

                                We did consider expanding the alternative leadhead codes to cover
                                Plain Bob and Grandsire at both even and odd stages.
                                However, the team thought that the traditional codes are rarely used other than for
                                Plain Bob leadhead methods at even stages.
                                We were therefore reluctant to add new material to the Framework covering
                                alternative codes for the other scenarios that we think is unlikely to be used.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                There's also a practical consideration in that we've adopted (e.g.) +1n for methods
                                with a '1n' leadend change, where n is the stage of the method.
                                However, for Plain Bob at odd stages the leadend change is just '1',
                                and for Grandsire at even stages it is 'x',
                                neither of which is easily derived from '+1n'.

                                    Thank you also for adding Appendix J. False Courseheads.
                                    As far as I know the only place this has been available online until now has been
                                    <a href="http://www.methods.org.uk/online/notes.htm">http://www.methods.org.uk/online/notes.htm</a>
                                    Apart from the formatting, Appendix J seems to be pretty much a cut and paste of
                                    the methods.org.uk page except that it omits the content at the bottom of the page
                                    relating to the 3 additional groups of false course-heads with no tenors together,
                                    and the credits to Edmund Shuttleworth and John Leary. Is this an oversight?

                                However, in light of your comment, we have now updated the fch appendix (which has now
                                been reordered as Appendix E) to include the existence of the X, Y and Z groups,
                                along with an example of how this information could be used.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                We will consider whether it would be worth expanding Appendix E in a future version
                                of the Framework to include the tenors-split members (i.e. the 720 courses with
                                all permutations of bells 2 to 7) for all fch groups.
                                However there is a question of usefulness to consider here -- with modern composing
                                software, the fch groups are used less than in previous eras.

                                    I note from the Ringing World article that there are plans rework the Framework
                                    website so that it is easier to use on small-screen devices such as smartphones.
                                    Personally, I think there are limits to how much you can reasonably be expected
                                    to bend over backwards on this particularly when only a small number of people
                                    might be interested in the content.
                                    Thanks again to the Framework team for all its vital work.

                                Yes, we will only do what can be achieved in a reasonable amount of work and time.

                                    It appears the Framework team are proposing to undo all the good they have done by
                                    reverting to having to ring at least a quarter peal to name a method.
                                    Doubles bands like our own have used the facility to name doubles variations by
                                    ringing an extent on many occasions.
                                    This is generally done prior to a quarter peal being rung to avoid either using a
                                    duplicate name or ringing something that has previously been rung to another name.
                                    As the article states: “Naming a new method is a privilege in ringing circles” but
                                    why does this privilege have to be confined to peal and quarter peal ringers?
                                    Why rule out a Sunday service band that wishes to ring something short for a special
                                    event?
                                    In the Ringing World of 4 June 2021 there is also some debate about eighth peals so
                                    presumably naming new methods in these is ruled out too.

                                    now?
                                    Please don’t go back to the outdated, elitist practice of having to ring a quarter
                                    peal or peal to name a method.

                                Following feedback from this consultation, we’re not moving forward with the
                                proposed change to require a quarter peal or longer to name a new method, and
                                version 2 has now been reverted to enable a new method to also be named by ringing
                                an extent.

                                The Framework team's thinking on this point had been as follows:
                            </p>

                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    Standardising on a quarter peal as the minimum length to name a new method sets
                                    the bar at the same level for all stages;
                                </li>

                                <li>
                                    Standardising on a QP+ gives a slight simplification of Framework requirements;
                                </li>

                                <li>
                                    Nearly all new methods named in the past year, which included many Minimus
                                    methods, were named in QPs or longer, rather than in extents,
                                    suggesting that ringers generally view a QP as a reasonable minimum length
                                    for naming a new method.
                                </li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>
                                However, as 5 people have spoken against this change in the consultation,
                                and none spoke in favour of it, we are not moving forward with this change.
                                We recognise that being able to name a new method by ringing an extent of it has been
                                the practice for many decades, and we shouldn't change this unless there's a strong
                                consensus to do so, which there doesn't appear to be.

                                    During the pandemic I have developed a system of ringing two real handbells with
                                    Abel using recordings of our other handbells. This is like “music minus one”.
                                    I ring two real handbells in proper handbell fashion, never looking at a computer
                                    screen, so effectively I am really handbell ringing. Where does this stand within
                                    new forms of method ringing?

                                This would be Simulator Ringing as defined in section 6.A.6 because
                                the ringing involves the use of a simulator (in your case Abel). It would also be
                                Automated Ringing as defined in section 6.A.8 because Abel is generating the sounds
                                of the bells that you're not ringing.

                                    We record all RW/BB published performances.
                                    We have Peals (as defined by the CCCBR), QPs (no real rules) and ‘call changes
                                    and other performances’ which can include anything from 120 call changes to a
                                    lost peal that someone wants to record because it was rung for an occasion.
                                    Norms. To quote the RW “If a norm was not followed, that does not mean,
                                    in the eyes of the CC, that a Peal (or other length) was not rung”.

                                    I understand the mandate of this work is to not be restrictive on what people can
                                    and can’t ring but as the Peal is the gold standard performance it should still
                                    be rung with restrictions and standards.
                                    That of course does not mean the performance should not be recorded or published
                                    (see above), but as a miscellaneous performance.
                                    Even with the added Adelaide amendment, most would still say that was a lost peal
                                    and should not have be reported as a peal of 5040 changes, even with “does not
                                    comply with all CC norms” attached.
                                    Does that 5040 count as a peal or not?
                                    Are we leaving it up to the reader to decide if the band rang a Peal?
                                    I concur with every single one of the norms, I don’t agree with the view that if
                                    one (or more) were not followed then a peal can be counted by the CC
                                    as suggested in the RW.

                                This followed decades of controversy over what should constitute a peal.
                                The CC therefore no longer determines what is a peal beyond defining its length
                                (a touch that is at least 5000 changes).
                                However, the CC does ask for disclosure in performance reports of anything
                                material about performances that would not reasonably be assumed if not stated.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Note that this is not a version 2 change – this new approach was put in place with
                                version 1 of the Framework.

                                However, affiliated societies of the CC are free to set more restrictive rules on
                                what they will include in their performance records if they wish.
                                For example, a society might decide to treat performances that didn't follow all the
                                performance norms on a case-by-case basis, and vote at the society's annual meeting
                                on whether to include them in the society's performance records.

                                    Thanks as ever for your work and transparency around developing the Framework.
                                    There is one particular new proposal that concerns me - "We’re therefore proposing
                                    in v2 that the minimum length to be rung in order to name a new method is a
                                    quarter peal". This seems seriously misguided and retrograde to me.
                                    I've rung various notable new methods by e.g. ringing an extent (120) of doubles.
                                    This was freely permissible not just in the 'recent dark ages',
                                    but also there are historic precedents going back to the dawn of ringing in the
                                    17th century.
                                    It seems very wrong to now try to restrict this.
                                    The given rationale in the RW article doesn't seem to make any sense - there
                                    isn't a problem of Minimus ringers causing havoc by naming extents.
                                    I'm fine with the suggestion that new methods can only be rung with
                                    all-human bands.
                                    But please don't go down this reactionary rabbit hole of mandating QP lengths to
                                    name new methods - it runs contrary to everything the Framework is about.

                                    “5E. Right to Name
                                    An unnamed Method or Variation may be named by the Band that first rang it in a
                                    Performance that is reported by the Ringing World, providing:
                                    a) The Performance was at least a Quarter Peal in Length;”

                                    I request you to change this back to the previous version of condition a):
                                    “a) The Performance is either at least a Quarter Peal or contains an Extent of
                                    the Method;”

                                    Here’s why:

                                    Your argument for the change is:
                                    “Naming a new method is a privilege in ringing circles.
                                    The new method is permanently added to the Central Council’s Methods Library and
                                    will always been known by the name given to it. This privilege is traditionally
                                    ‘earned’ by ringing a sufficient amount of the new method to justify its
                                    recording in the Library, and many would consider ringing 6 changes, or 24 or 120,
                                    to be insufficient.”

                                    I was part of the band that rang an extent of a new Minimus method,
                                    as a result of which we exercised our right to name the method after the tower
                                    where it was rung (the home tower for three of us).
                                    I assure you that the band were well aware of the privilege of being able to
                                    name a method.
                                    As you know, ringing on 4 bells is not as easy as it sounds,
                                    and the new method is not an easy method. We all did our homework, concentrated
                                    hard and rang with good striking. Actually, we rang it several times in order
                                    to get it sounding really nice. Anyone who thinks that our effort was insufficient
                                    is welcome to come and ring it with us!

                                    In addition, the method was rung as part of our service ringing,
                                    and in memory of a much-respected member of the church community.
                                    This shows that the band care about their church, and I can tell you that it meant
                                    a lot to us to have our “own” method. The ringers of 2, 3 and 4, who are members of
                                    the local band, have all loyally carried on ringing at the tower every week,
                                    when we could have abandoned it and been welcomed at more impressive towers.
                                    So I suggest that we have most certainly “earned” the right to name a method after
                                    the tower to which we have dedicated a generous proportion of our lives, both by
                                    ringing and by supporting the church in other ways.

                                    only an extent by ringing hundreds of such methods in a day and naming them all?
                                    Possibly, but from what you write in your RW article about Version 2 that does not
                                    seem to be occurring. In any case, Version 2 would still allow a band to do that,
                                    by ringing the methods consecutively in a quarter peal. They would still only have
                                    rung one extent of each method, so what is the difference?

                                    towers, who apparently “aren’t to be allowed to get away with it”! What have we

                                    allowed to have the pleasure of naming a method after a place that we care about?

                                    My main feedback concerns the proposal that methods can no longer be named in
                                    extents that happen to be shorter than 1250 changes. I do not support this
                                    proposal, the reasoning for my objection being as follows:

                                    of methods and the regulating of an official methods library is one area where
                                    enforcement has to come into it. But I still think that this is an unjustified
                                    proposal.

                                    of bells, then method m has done all that has been required of it: there are no
                                    further rows that can be rung. To me this seems a solid mathematical basis for
                                    naming a new method. The reason we would usually repeat some of those extents/rows
                                    on fewer than 7 bells is to make the performance a quarter peal+ length.
                                    But this is an arbitrary convention. The reason that quarter peals are around
                                    1250 rows is because peals are around 5000 rows, and the reason that peals are
                                    around 5000 rows is because the 1715 peal at Norwich was a performance of the
                                    extent of Triples. So, arguably the reason that performances of 1250 rows are
                                    popular has its roots in the extent of Triples. But the new proposal turns this
                                    on its head and now makes the arbitrary 1250 the factor in naming methods rather
                                    than the extent, and to me this seems the wrong way round.

                                    Does this mean that you could ring 60 rows of a new Doubles method and 1200
                                    rows of Stedman Doubles for the rest of the quarter peal?
                                    This surely entails that you have rung less than an extent of the new method,
                                    yet you still wouldn't be permitted to name the new method in a solitary extent
                                    on its own.

                                    stages.
                                    I realize that some people probably abuse the privilege of naming methods by
                                    naming several new Minimus methods to extents in one practice night.
                                    A 120 in a new Doubles method might be slightly harder to learn and execute,
                                    in terms of complexity, time taken to ring, and the number of ringers required.
                                    Similarly a 720 in a new Minor method is harder still. On this basis,
                                    if you really do feel that you have to enforce a length policy, why not propose
                                    that performances of new methods on four bells or fewer must be at least 120 rows?
                                    I don't like this much either, but I would still rather have this option than not
                                    be able to name Doubles and Minor methods in 120s and 720s respectively.

                                    5.) Which leads me to my next point. There are some very elegant and intriguing
                                    extents of Doubles and Minor out there, particularly extents of new principles.
                                    It is fascinating how and why some of these work. In ringing these extents and
                                    naming the new methods, it seems right to only ring the extent itself,
                                    the extent which the composer has crafted. To ring a longer length just for the
                                    sake of ringing a quarter peal rather than a 120 or 720 seems a great shame and
                                    to diminish the focus of the single extent. Why must you have to ring that extent
                                    again?
                                    As I said in (2.), the extent has achieved all that is possible to achieve in
                                    the method.
                                    I do realize that you might have difficulty finding a band to join you for a
                                    720 of Minor rather than a quarter peal, and that your research has shown that
                                    people usually do ring a quarter peal+ length in a new method. But why stop those
                                    of us who wish to name the solitary extent? This ties in with the recent
                                    suggestion in the RW that 'eighth peals' could become a benchmark performance
                                    length, which I responded to in support.

                                    Section 3.B.1 - numbering of the rows. There is no indication of which way the
                                    numbers run. Conventionally UK ringers number from the treble (1) down the scale.
                                    I note that continental ringers number in the reverse order with their tenor being
                                    no.1. (See Facebook pages 'Post your own bell pictures' and 'Glockenfreunde'.)

                                    be expanded and clarified by stating that bell no.1 is the smallest or highest

                                We had much debate on the definition of Row during development of the Framework,
                                including whether numbering by descending order of pitch ought to be built into
                                the top-level definition.
                                The essential point here is that nothing breaks in method ringing theory if bells
                                are numbered other than by descending order of pitch.
                                For this reason, we thought it was better and more flexible not to build descending
                                order into the top-level definition.
                                Instead, we stated in the Further Explanation section for Row that bells are usually
                                numbered in descending order of pitch.

                                    bells don't occupy every place in a lead. Some because they are skipping over

                                That’s correct that Little isn't used in the method title for methods with
                                jump changes.
                                This is driven by section 5.B of the Framework.
                                Note that the Little class still applies if the hunt bell doesn’t ring in all the
                                places of the stage – it just isn’t included in the title for a Jump method.
                                This is the same approach as for Hybrid methods.

                                    ringers for a 12345-single were a reality). Therefore remove 3.C.2 and make

                                    ringing. It would help ringers’ development to have a structure around these
                                    Performances, and more widespread recognition of them by publication.

                                    then there is no incentive to develop the structures that allow ringers to
                                    exchange and compare their Performances. The better question is “What harm would
                                    it do to include them?” There is certainly more enthusiasm for these Performances

                                    in the 2000s had no fundamental affect on naming Minor methods.

                                    720s, ... because like me they have come to the conclusion that adding a block
                                    of changes that is less than an extent onto an extent to make it quarter of a
                                    length that only really means anything for triples, is actually quite odd. 720

                                    ringing, we need to aid communication by having agreed names for the entities we
                                    are discussing. Appendix E A seeks a simple and permissive descriptive Framework,
                                    and this needs to apply to Method naming as well as Performance ringing.
                                    It all argues for fewer, rather than more, restrictions on creating Method names …

                                    a) Towerbell Style: Full-circle ringing with rope and wheel, using handstroke
                                    and backstroke actions;
                                    b) Handbell Style: Alternating upstrokes and downstrokes -- usually upstrokes
                                    for handstrokes and downstrokes for backstrokes;
                                    c) Keyboard Style: Bells sound via presses on a keyboard, such as with Online
                                    Ringing (see Section 6.A.7) or a carillon;
                                    d) Other Style: To be specified in Performance Reports, such as ringing on the
                                    frame or tapping bells;
                                    e) Mixed Style: More than one of the above styles were used in a Performance ”

                                    Each participant has one bell and everyone stands in a row: the bells may be
                                    ordinary handbells, but tabletop bells in plunger-style also work well. They may pass the bells between them, and this is covered above by the lapping style. Distinctive to this Scouting Style is that participants take the bells with them and change places with one another. The basic system is that all participants face the same way, and those moving up the Row pass behind those moving down the Row, the Row always being rung left to right from the view of the Conductor. …

                                    Those moving up at handstroke make one diagonal step with their left foot, and
                                    return to the line with another diagonal step with their right foot, thus passing
                                    those moving down doing the same thing in the opposite direction: if making a
                                    place, they turn around on the spot, and when dodging they continue with their
                                    expected next foot but do the movement backwards. For example to dodge up,
                                    take one diagonal right-foot-backwards step followed by a backwards diagonal
                                    left footstep, in a do-si-do fashion with the other dodging participant.

                                    making the scope of Method Ringing as wide as it could possibly be, *and* as a
                                    backstop, required disclosure of anything not previously contemplated, and
                                    allowing ringers to make their own assessment of which Performances they were
                                    interested in. This is in addition to the disclosure requirements already
                                    necessary for non-traditional ringing.

                                    (4) Within the development of Version 1 it seemed worthwhile to include a scoping
                                    description, along the lines that there has to be a boundary somewhere, and
                                    that ended up as Appendix E D. This eschewed, for example, ringing when two or
                                    more bells deliberately strike at the same time, such as firing or partial firing.
                                    Later, a catch-all reporting requirement was included at 6.C.2.o), encompassing
                                    everything that was been out of scope, as a Performance that *can* be reported
                                    with a note about the norms not followed.

                                    included to allow accurate description of any Performances that may happen in
                                    the future. Similarly the Framework eschews value judgements: it is for the
                                    readers to decide if they find Performances to be not-ringing, to be silly,
                                    or to be unworthy for any other reason. The Framework does not rank ringing in
                                    any order-of-worth, or find anything so distantly outside the boundary of ringing
                                    that it should not be contemplated, or published if reported.

                                Appendix A.B allows for this -- the full row transposition would be included in
                                square brackets, e.g. [32165478].
                                But note that Appendix A.B.7 encourages this, for clarity, to be written
                                [321][654]78 since 78 is standard place notation,
                                and there are two separate jumping groups.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                However, the above notation is verbose for many jumps that have been
                                used in methods to date, so Appendix A.B also provides a more compact form.
                                E.g. (24) -- meaning the bell in 2nd's place jumps to 4th's place,
                                and the bells in 3rd's and 4th's places both move down a place -- is more
                                compact than specifying [134265].

                                    (or not), but the question here is the Performances rung primarily in the
                                    rest of the country by ordinary ringers who need to be encouraged into seeing
                                    that the Ringing theory inside the Framework is relevant to them.

                                We continue to think that if the ringing community believes there is a
                                need for something similar for call change ringing (and tolling, and
                                firing, and ringing up & down), it should be documented separately from the
                                Framework for Method Ringing.
