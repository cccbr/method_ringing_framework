                                A sequence of bells in which each bell rings once and only once. Bells are incrementally numbered in order from highest to lowest pitch,
                                and each is usually represented in a Row by a single digit or letter.

                                        Bells are numbered in descending order of their pitch and may be referred to using either cardinal or ordinal numbers.
                                        Number 1 is used for the bell with the highest pitch (the treble), number 2 for the next highest pitch and so on.
                                        The bell with the lowest pitch is also referred to as the tenor. The numbering and naming of treble and tenor always
                                        relates solely to the set of bells comprising the Row, ignoring any others that may be rung at other times.

                                        Rows are normally shown in columns so that the path of individual bells can be visualised by looking down the column.
                                        In order to keep the columns aligned, a fixed font can be used with single characters representing each bell.
                                        Conventionally '0' (zero) is used to represent 10 and either upper or lower case letters (excluding 'I', 'O' and 'X') are
                                        used for bells 11 to 33 as follows:
                                        'E' (Eleven); 'T' (Twelve); 'A' (Thirteen); 'B' (Fourteen); 'C' (Fifteen); 'D' (Sixteen); 'F' (Seventeen); 'G' (Eighteen);

                                        More formally, a Place is a position where an individual bell can ring within a Row,

                                        Positions are numbered using cardinal numbers, starting with 1 for the bell that
                                        rings first, and increasing sequentially for each next bell to ring e.g. the bell that
                                        rings second in a Row is in Position 2.

                                        A Place is an equivalent term for a Position, but Places are numbered using ordinal
                                        numbers in the possessive form. E.g. the bell that rings second in a Row is in 2nd's
                                        Place. 2nd's Place here is a reference to the Place the 2nd bell is in when ringing
                                        Rounds.

                                        However, when using Places, the bell in 1st Place is normally said to be Leading.
                                        And the bell in the last Place of the Row is said to be Lying. E.g. in the Row 142536,
                                        the Treble is Leading, and in the Row 2143658709, the 9th is Lying.

                                        Note that in a Row containing one or more cover bells, the numbering of the Places
                                        may be modified to exclude the cover bell(s). E.g. when ringing Triples with a cover
                                        bell in 8th's Place, the bell in 7th's place may be said to be Lying.

                                    applying the pair of Changes x16 except (a) if the Treble is Leading after an x
                                    Change, replace the next 16 Change with a 12 Change, and (b) if the 2nd or 4th is
                                    Leading after an x Change, replace the next 16 Change with a 14 Change. In this
                                    example, the sequence of Changes varies depending on the Rows generated so using a
                                    different starting Row could generate a different sequence of changes.

                                        same 6 bells ring in all Rows of the Block, such that the other 4 bells in the tower do
