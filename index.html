                                A sequence of bells in which each bell rings once and only once. Bells are incrementally numbered in order from highest to lowest pitch, and each is usually represented in a Row by a single digit or letter

                                        Bells are numbered in descending order of their pitch and may be referred to using either cardinal or ordinal numbers.
                                        Number 1 is used for the bell with the highest pitch (the treble), number 2 for the next highest pitch and so on.
                                        The bell with the lowest pitch is also referred to as the tenor.

                                        Rows are normally shown in columns so that the path of individual bells can be visualised by looking down the column.
                                        In order to keep the columns aligned, a fixed font can be used with single characters representing each bell.
                                        Conventionally '0' (zero) is used to represent 10 and either upper or lower case letters (excluding 'I', 'O' and 'X') are
                                        used for bells 11 to 33 as follows:
                                        'E' (Eleven); 'T' (Twelve); 'A' (Thirteen); 'B' (Fourteen); 'C' (Fifteen); 'D' (Sixteen); 'F' (Seventeen); 'G' (Eighteen);

                                        A Place is an equivalent term for a Position, but Places are numbered using ordinal
                                        numbers in the possessive form. E.g. the bell that rings second in a Row is in 2nd's
                                        Place. 2nd's Place here is a reference to the Place the 2nd bell is in when ringing

                                        may be modified to exclude the cover bell(s). E.g. when ringing Triples with a cover

                                    example, the sequence of Changes varies depending on the Rows generated. In
