                                straightforward the new framework is, the more widely it will be understood across the ringing
                                community and the more accessible it will be to new ringers joining the Exercise. At the same
                                time, it is recognised that method ringing has some inherent complexity resulting from both its
                                mathematical foundation and its rich history, such that not all complexity can be eliminated.

                                are today, or with only minimal alterations in the interests of standardisation and simplification.
                                The greater permissiveness of the new framework will mostly be of interest to more advanced
                                ringers who wish to explore new forms of method ringing.

                                    The definition of Change has been expanded to include any transformation of one row into
                                    the next. This facilitates the definition of jump changes and identity changes. The term adjacent change
                                    has been introduced to be equivalent to the previous definition of Change (in Decision E.(A).1).

                                    Truth is based upon the n+1 principle i.e. 0 to n complete extents + 1 partial extent.
                                    In other words a block of rows is considered true if either all its rows are distinct
                                    (only occur once) or if the block is longer than an extent, the remaining rows are
                                    distinct after removing any complete extents, regardless of where these rows occur in
                                    the block.

                                    Rows may have more than one cover bell. Fixed cover places are excluded when determining
                                    truth, while variable cover places are included. “Fixed cover place”, “variable cover
                                    place” and “true” are all defined in the new framework.

                                    Ringing of all lengths on all stages should be treated alike for simplicity, consistency and
                                    permissiveness. The definitions should be relevant and applicable to all ringing, not just
                                    peals. Hence the definition of true applies equally to touches, quarter peals and peals,
                                    and if 5000 changes is a peal of Major, then it is also sufficient for a peal of Minor.

                                    The Conditions for Peal Ringing in Decision D have been replaced by performance reporting
                                    requirements. Under this new permissive framework, the onus is placed upon the bands
                                    ringing a performance to determine if a performance merits publication. The
                                    requirement is to report any non-standard characteristic in the performance report
                                    such that this can be used in subsequent analyses.
