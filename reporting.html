                                        was 720 Changes, the second Round Block was 1440 Changes, and the remaining

                                        This example comprises 4 Methods and 2 Variations. The two Variations, April
                                        Day and Kennington, are based on Plain Bob,
                                        and so are members of the Plain Class.
                                        Variations do not use Class Descriptors, so this Performance doesn't have a
                                        common Class Descriptor that can be used in the
                                        Performance Title.
                                        However, Plain may optionally be included in the Performance Title since all
                                        Methods and Variations rung are members of this Class.
                                        Mixed has also optionally been used in the Performance Title since this is a
                                        multi-Method
                                        Performance, but doesn't include a Spliced Composition.
                                        (Given the optional terms, this Performance Title could be any of:
                                        1320 Mixed Plain Doubles, 1320 Mixed Doubles, 1320 Plain Doubles, or 1320
                                        Doubles.)

                                        Since this example is a multi-Stage Performance, the Stage Names are included
                                        in the Performance Detail.
                                        Also, although Plain Bob and Grandsire are both members of the Bob Class of
                                        Methods,
                                        Grandsire is an exception (see Section 5.F.1) in which the Bob Class Descriptor
                                        is not used.
                                        Bob therefore cannot be used in the Performance Title, but since St Clement's
                                        and Grandsire are both part of the Plain Class of Methods,
                                        Plain may optionally be included in the Performance Title (otherwise the
                                        Performance Title is 5040 Doubles and Minor).

                                        Martyrs Link has one Stationary Bell, and in this example, the Stationary Bell
                                        was not affected by any Calls.
                                        The Effective Stage of the Performance was therefore Triples.
                                        Since the Effective Stage is lower than the highest Stage of Method rung, the

                                c) Key presses (such as with a computer keyboard or carillon);<br />

                                d) On handbells the bells were retained in hand throughout the Performance;<br />

                                e.g. making calls, detecting or correcting errors;<br />
                                h) For Online Ringing, simulated sound was used,

                                i) In any given Row of the Performance, all bells rang at the same stroke (i.e. all
                                handstroke or all backstroke);<br />

                                    For norm c), the ethos of ringing is one of continuous performance.
                                    In the tower there is a clear distinction - the ringing either keeps going or it
                                    stops.
                                    But with handbell and keypress performances, and especially Distributed Ringing
                                    with keypresses, extended pauses are physically possible despite the ringers not
                                    intentionally stopping and re-starting.
                                    Rather than attempt to define a cutoff time, the Framework relies on the good
                                    judgement of the band in applying this norm.

                                    For norm m), one person could (e.g.) ring a Performance of Minimus four in hand.
                                    The umpire provides corroboration that the Performance took place as reported.
                                    Note that if this norm is not followed (i.e. no umpire was present for a single
                                    person performance),
                                    this will be evident from 6.B.1 f) and h) above, so in practice no further
                                    disclosure is required.
                                </p>

                                    For norm n), if, for example, an attempt to ring 7 Extents of Minor was lost in the
                                    5th extent, the first 4 Extents are not normally considered to constitute a
                                    successful Performance.
                                    Similarly, if 7 Extents of Minor are rung but the 1st Extent is found to be false,
                                    the last 6 Extents are not normally considered to constitute a successful
                                    Performance.
                                    However, norm n) does not apply to Performances that were called round earlier than
                                    was intended at the outset of the attempt.
                                    It also does not apply to false starts, or to anything rung before or after the
                                    intended Performance.
                                </p>

                                    Re: norm o), a Performance might start in the middle of a Row, or different
                                    Rows in a Performance might involve different numbers of bells ringing.
                                    These are examples of departures from norm o), and explanation should be provided
                                    in the footnotes.
