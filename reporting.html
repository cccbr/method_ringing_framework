                                b) 'Spliced' if the Performance was Spliced (see Section 6.A.3 below);<br />
                                c) Name(s) of the Method(s) rung in the Performance. Where a Performance comprised more than one Method, this component of the Performance Title is optional -- 
                                   the Method Names can be determined from the Performance Detail (see Section 6.Z.2 below);<br />
                                d) Common Method Class(es), if any;<br />
                                e) 'Variable Cover' if the Performance included Calls that affected Cover Bell(s);<br />
                                f) Name(s) of the Stage(s) of the Method(s) rung in the Performance, listed in order of lowest Stage to highest Stage.<br />
                                   However, if the Effective Stage of the Performance is lower than the Stage of the highest Stage Method rung in the Performance,
                                   then only the Effective Stage is shown in the Performance Title.<br />
                                   This does not apply to Performances with Accepted Truth -- in this case, the two Stages rung are included in the Performance Title.

                                b) The Performance was a True Touch, or a Touch with Accepted Truth (as defined in Section 3.J);<br />
                                c) The Performance was rung without interval;<br />
                                d) On handbells the bells were retained in hand throughout the Performance;<br />
                                e) The same person or persons rang each bell or bells continuously throughout the Performance;<br />
                                f) Neither ringers nor conductor(s) used any physical aids to memory during the Performance;<br />
                                g) No person not ringing provided any assistance in the execution of the ringing during the Performance,
                                    e.g. making calls, detecting or correcting errors;<br />
                                h) Tower bells (or simulations thereof) were rung full-circle style;<br />
                                i) Handbells (or simulations thereof) were rung in alternating up-strokes and down-strokes;<br />
                                j) If Cover Bell(s) were used, these were in the highest Place(s) of the Rows;<br />
                                k) Jump Changes were not used;<br />
                                l) Only one Method was rung in any one Row;<br />
                                m) The Effective Stage of the Performance was not lower than the highest Stage of Method rung in the Performance;<br />
                                n) The Performance was consistent with this framework.
